    <h1> Sea Wasp </h1>
    <p> The sea wasp, or box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri),
        is undoubtedly the most venomous animal on the
        planet, as a single specimen contains enough venom
        to kill more than 50 people. This species mainly
        inhabits the sea near Australia and New Guinea.

        The sea wasp can have tentacles up to
        3 meters (9'10'') long. As they age, their
        venom becomes more lethal, being able to kill
        a person in minutes. However, the deadliness
        of sea wasp venom depends on how big is the area
        of the sting. If you are stung by a sea wasp
        you must contact a hospital as soon as
        possible, and if you have it at hand, apply vinegar. </p>
